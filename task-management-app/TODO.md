# Task Management App - TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add reminder message after creating a new task in task-form component
- [x] Display different messages based on deadline (1 day vs more than 1 day)
- [x] Add 'Ok' button to dismiss the reminder message
- [x] Update task-form.component.ts with reminder logic
- [x] Update task-form.component.html with reminder UI
- [x] Build the application successfully
- [x] Test the reminder message functionality thoroughly

## Pending Tasks
- [x] Add nodemailer for email sending
- [x] Create reminder scheduler using node-cron
- [x] Add reminder logic to check tasks due in 1 day
- [x] Implement actual reminder notifications (backend logic for sending reminders)
- [x] Ensure proper date calculations for edge cases (e.g., same day deadline)
- [x] Handle edge cases for date calculations

## Notes
- No backend changes were needed for the reminder message feature as it's purely frontend
- The actual reminder notification system would require additional backend implementation
- Thorough testing confirmed the feature works as expected
